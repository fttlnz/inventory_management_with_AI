#Inventory management with AI

## Summary

This project aims to simplify warehouse inventory management using machine learning. By predicting stock demand and automating replenishment alerts, it reduces waste, prevents shortages, and optimizes storage space.

## Background

Managing inventory efficiently is a common challenge for businesses. Overstocking leads to waste and increased costs, while understocking causes delays and lost sales. A smart system can help businesses:

Predict demand based on historical data

Optimize stock levels to prevent shortages and overstocking

Reduce manual tracking efforts and human errors

## How is it used?

The system collects inventory data from warehouse records, sales history, and external factors (e.g., seasonal trends). The machine learning model analyzes the data and provides:

Demand predictions for upcoming periods

Automatic stock replenishment alerts

Insights to optimize storage space

## Users:

Warehouse managers

Retailers

E-commerce businesses

##Example workflow:

The system receives real-time stock updates.

Machine learning algorithms predict future demand.

The system generates alerts for low stock items.

Managers adjust restocking orders accordingly.

## Data sources and AI methods

The system uses:

Historical sales data

Warehouse stock records

Seasonal and market trends

Machine learning methods used:

Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)

Anomaly detection for unusual demand patterns

Clustering for stock categorization

## Challenges

Handling unexpected demand fluctuations

Data quality and completeness

Ethical considerations in AI-driven decision-making

## What next?

To enhance the system, we plan to:

Integrate with IoT devices for real-time stock tracking

Improve accuracy with reinforcement learning

Expand predictive models to multiple industries
